# Hi, I'm Nate 

<img src=".png" alt="banner that says - ">

I'm a data scientist and applied researcher with a passion for using statistics and analytics to tackle complex, real-world challenges. While R is my favorite language for coding, I also have extensive experience in Python, SQL, and Power BI.

Currently, I'm a Senior Data Scientist at Sierra Space, where I lead projects across the data stackâ€”from backend integration to frontend visualization. My work often involves uncovering patterns in data to enhance program execution, blending both descriptive and predictive approaches.

Before this, I was a Data & Innovation Analyst for the City of Madison on the <a href="">Data and Innovation Team</a>, where I applied advanced analytics to address issues such as equity and sustainability. I also bring an <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n2-up3oAAAAJ&hl=en">academic background</a> focused on the psychological drivers of human behavior, including how emotions influence pro-environmental actions.
