# Hi, I'm Nate 

<img src=".png" alt="banner that says - ">

I'm a data scientist and applied researcher with a passion for using statistics and analytics to tackle complex, real-world challenges. While R is my favorite language for coding, I also have extensive experience in Python, SQL, and Power BI.

Currently, I'm a Senior Data Scientist at Sierra Space, where I lead projects across the data stackâ€”from backend integration to frontend visualization. My work often involves uncovering patterns in data to enhance program execution, blending both descriptive and predictive approaches.

Before this, I was a Data & Innovation Analyst for the City of Madison, where I applied advanced analytics to address issues such as equity and sustainability. I also bring an academic background focused on the psychological drivers of human behavior, including how emotions influence pro-environmental actions.





Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. In 2020, I was selected to be an inaugural <a href="https://stars.github.com/">GitHub Star ðŸŒŸ</a> based on my involvement in the tech community.  My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch <a href="https://www.reactrobins.com/">React Robins</a>, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
