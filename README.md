# Hi, I'm Nate 

<img src="https://github.com/NathanJShipley/nathanjshipley/blob/main/github-header-image.png">

I'm a data scientist and applied researcher with a passion for using statistics and analytics to tackle complex, real-world challenges. While R is my favorite language for coding, I also have extensive experience in Python, SQL, and Power BI.

Currently, I'm a Senior Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.sierraspace.com/">Sierra Space</a>, where I lead projects across the data stack—from backend integration to frontend visualization. My work often involves uncovering patterns in data to enhance program execution, blending both descriptive and predictive approaches.

Before this, I was a Data & Innovation Analyst for the City of Madison on the <a href="https://www.cityofmadison.com/finance/data-innovation">Data and Innovation Team</a>, where I applied advanced analytics to address issues such as equity and sustainability. I also bring an <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n2-up3oAAAAJ&hl=en">academic background</a> focused on the psychological drivers of human behavior, including how emotions influence pro-environmental actions.

Outside of work, I’m an avid birder who loves to blend my passion for birding with data analysis. I’m always on the lookout for new ways to analyze my own birding data, a pursuit that’s showcased in my R Shiny application below. 😊
